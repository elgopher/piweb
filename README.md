# piweb

**Experimental Pi backend for web browsers.**

A replacement for [piebiten](https://github.com/elgopher/pi/tree/master/piebiten) and [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/).

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

The aim of this project is to create a new backend for [Pi](https://github.com/elgopher/pi) games that runs efficiently in modern web browsers and offers significant improvements over the standard [piebiten](https://github.com/elgopher/pi/tree/master/piebiten) backend:

### ðŸ“¦ Smaller Binary Size

* At least **2Ã— smaller** `.wasm` output

### ðŸ”Š Better Audio

* **Minimal latency** â€” as low as **20 ms** (compared to 60 ms in piebiten)
* **Glitch-free playback** â€” thanks to audio processing in a high-priority, separate audio thread

---

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

These improvements are possible thanks to:

* **Audio Worklet API** â€“ the browser-native API for real-time, low-latency audio processing
* Writing the code directly in **JavaScript**
* Reducing the number of dependencies

## ðŸš§ Status

This is an experimental project. Some features are ready, some are not. Some features are buggy and generally not all possible platforms are supported:

* [x] graphics rendering using Canvas2D
* [x] keyboard support
* [x] gamepad support
* [x] mouse support
* [ ] debug mode support
* [x] desktop web browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari etc.
* [ ] mobile web browsers - virtual keyboard and gamepad support
* [ ] audio support
* [x] 3x smaller WASM binary - Snake game is 3 MB (0.9 MB after gzip) instead of 10 MB
